## Functions
```c++
// This is a function called Hello
void Hello()
{

}

// This is where code execution begins
void main()
{
   // So we move on to executing the code in the Hello function
   Hello();
}
```
* After the code in the called function has completed executing, we continue executing the code from where the function was called.

## Calculations
```c++
a = (b + c) / d;
```

## Conditions
```c++
if () 
{

}
```
* If the calculation in the condition is not equal to 0, then the body of the condition will be satisfied. 

## Loops
```c++
while () 
{

} 
```
* If the calculation in the loop condition is not equal to 0, then the body of the loop will be executed.
